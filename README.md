# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀

This project showcases the development of a modern data warehouse using SQL Server. It demonstrates the entire pipeline, including **ETL processes**, **data modeling**, and **analytics**—ideal for those interested in **data engineering** and **data analytics**.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture
The project follows a **Medallion Architecture** to structure the data warehouse with three key layers:

### **Bronze Layer**: 
Stores raw data directly from the source systems. Data is loaded into SQL Server from CSV files.

### **Silver Layer**:
Data is cleansed, standardized, and transformed to prepare it for deeper analysis.

### **Gold Layer**:
Contains business-ready, modeled data structured into a **star schema** for efficient reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves:

- **Data Architecture**: Design a modern data warehouse using **Medallion Architecture** with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extract, transform, and load data from source systems into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Develop fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Generate insights through SQL-based reports and dashboards.
