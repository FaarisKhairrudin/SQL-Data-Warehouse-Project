# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project (Gold Layer Development)  
Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! üöÄ  

This project aims to build a **modern data warehouse** using SQL Server, focusing on **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes**, **data modeling**, and **analytics** to support data-driven decision-making.  

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture  
The repository follows the **Medallion Architecture**, dividing the data warehouse into three main layers. The current phase of development is focused on the **Gold Layer**, which will provide business-ready data for advanced analysis.

### **Bronze Layer** (Completed)  
This layer stores raw data directly from source systems without modifications. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server, forming the foundation for further processing.  

### **Silver Layer** (Completed)  
At this stage, data is cleansed, standardized, and transformed to ensure consistency and quality before analysis.  

### **Gold Layer** (In Progress)  
The Gold Layer contains structured, business-ready data modeled using a **star schema** to optimize reporting and analytics. The current focus is on building fact and dimension tables to enhance query efficiency.  

## üìñ Project Overview  
This project covers several key aspects:  

- **Data Architecture**: Implementing the **Medallion Architecture**, currently focusing on the Gold Layer.  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data into the warehouse.  
- **Data Modeling**: Designing fact and dimension tables to support business analytics.  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Generating SQL-based reports to uncover trends and patterns in the data.  

## üéØ Key Skills Developed  
- **SQL Development**  
- **Data Architecture**  
- **Data Engineering**  
- **ETL Pipeline Development**  
- **Data Analytics**  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Resources  
- **Datasets**: CSV files used in the project.  
- **SQL Server Express**: A lightweight database server.  
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: A GUI tool for database management.  
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and collaboration.  
- **Draw.io**: For designing data models and workflows.  
- **Notion**: Project management and documentation tool.  

## üöÄ Project Requirements  

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)  
**Objective**: Develop a modern data warehouse that integrates sales data to support advanced analytics.  

**Specifications**:  
- **Data Sources**: Data extracted from ERP and CRM systems in CSV format.  
- **Data Quality**: Ensure clean, standardized, and reliable data.  
- **Integration**: Combine multiple sources into a well-structured, analytics-friendly model.  
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historical data retention is not required.  
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model for business and analytics teams.  

### BI & Analytics (Data Analysis)  
**Objective**: Deliver data-driven insights for business decision-making, including:  
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**  
- **Product Performance Evaluation**  
- **Sales Trend Identification**  

The generated reports will help stakeholders make informed decisions based on real data.
